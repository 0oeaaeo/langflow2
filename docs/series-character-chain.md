For the example, we used `OpenAI` as the LLM, but you can use any LLM that has an API. Make sure to get the API key from the LLM provider. For example, [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/){.internal-link target=\_blank} requires you to create an account to get your API key.

<br>

Check out the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview){.internal-link target=\_blank} documentation to learn more about the API and the options that contain in the node.
