# How to Upload Examples

We welcome all examples that can help our community learn and explore the features of our open-source software.
Langflow Examples is a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow_examples){.internal-link target=_blank} that contains examples of flows that you can upload to Langflow.

To upload examples to Langflow, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a Flow:** First, create a flow using Langflow. You can use any of the available templates or create a new flow from scratch.

2. **Export the Flow:**: Once you have created a flow, export it as a .json file. Make sure to give your file a descriptive name and include a brief description of what your flow does.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Finally, submit a pull request (PR) to the examples folder. Make sure to include your .json file in the PR.

Here are some additional guidelines to follow when submitting examples:
