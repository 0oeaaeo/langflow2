# ðŸ’» Run Locally
Run locally by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies from your system.

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
  - Poetry
  - Node.js

For the backend, you will need to install the dependencies and start the development server.
```bash
poetry install
make run_backend
```
For the frontend, you will need to install the dependencies and start the development server.
```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm start
```
