# Populating a Prompt Variable with a Document

## Overview

This walkthrough provides a step-by-step guide on how to load a document into a Prompt variable. It is a simple two-part process:

1. **Prompt Variable Definition:** We start by defining a Prompt variable within the PromptTemplate component. This variable will serve as the placeholder for our document's content.

2. **WebBaseLoader Connection:** Next, we link a WebBaseLoader to the Prompt variable we've just created. This will facilitate the flow building process and ensure the content of the document is properly loaded.

Upon successful completion of these steps, you'll be able to start a chat with the document's content readily available within the conversational context. This provides seamless integration of the document into the chat, enhancing the user's experience by making relevant information more accessible.

Please follow the steps outlined in the interactive guide to understand the process in detail.
